## 📜 Description:
Developed a clone of the ***"LinkedIn App"***. Used Flutter SDK and Dart programming language to make it a cross-platform application i.e. to have support for both iOS and Android with a single codebase. Currently it consists only of limited functionalities with static user interface elements, but can later be configured to fetch data from a remote database or server with the help of APIs.
